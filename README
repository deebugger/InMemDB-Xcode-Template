This is an Xcode 7 file template, which creates an In-Memory model and store, and returns a context.

This is useful for unit-testing Core Data code.

Preparation:
------------
You should place the directory 'In-Memory DB.xctemplate' in the following location for Xcode to load it as a custom file template:

~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/Custom


Basic usage:
------------
1. Import the template into your Tests folder with an appropriate name (such as InMem.swift)
2. In your unit-tests you can now call InMem.context to get a fresh NSManagedObjectContext instance


Notes:
------
Every time you call InMem.context, you'll get a context for a new store. This is useful because usually in unit-tests you want to start with a fersh store. The proper way to use this is to call this line at the beginning of each function, or as a constant in your unit-test file:

let context = InMem.context

And then use 'context' at your heart's content. Each function should now have a fresh new context to play around with.
